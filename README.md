## ðŸ’¡ Challenge Overview

Throughout this challenge, I'll be tackling various aspects of DevOps, including:

- **Version Control**: Mastering Git and GitHub to manage source code efficiently.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automating deployments using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and more.
- **Cloud Platforms**: Gaining expertise in AWS, Azure, and GCP to manage infrastructure as code.
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Using Docker and Kubernetes for efficient container management.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automating infrastructure with tools like Terraform and Ansible.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Implementing monitoring solutions with Prometheus and the ELK stack.

## ðŸ“… Daily Challenges

Each day of the challenge, Iâ€™ll be tackling new tasks and demonstrating my learning journey. Hereâ€™s an example of the first task:

### Day 1: [AWS Weather Dashboard Application](https://github.com/blessingaliu/30DayDevopsChallenge/tree/main/Day1-WeatherDashboard)

On Day 1, I set up a local Git repository and pushed it to GitHub. This serves as the foundation for my entire challenge and allows me to track and share my progress.

Hereâ€™s a quick summary of what was done:

- Created a new directory and initialized it with Git.
- Added and committed my changes to the repo.
- Set up a GitHub repository and pushed the changes there for version control.

This initial setup is crucial as it forms the version-controlled environment where Iâ€™ll be managing all the challenges ahead.
